<p>
  <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> (AKA 11ty) is a static site generator for JavaScript. I like it becuase it allows you to mix and match different template engines (hbs, nunjucks, liquid, markdown), even in the same file.
</p>

<p>This file is a hbs (Handlebars) file so I am writing HTML-ish code right now, but I can also access template variables if I've created any. I don't have much here but I could show the page url:</p>

<pre><code>{{ this.page.url }}</code></pre>
